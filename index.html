<div id="letter"style="text-align: left;">
<h4 id="greeting">Dear Ma'am, <br> As I will be taking a break from Whitehat Jr after this set of classes, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you. You have taught me such a wide variety of things, and I am sure I would not have been able to progress at all without your guidance and support.</h4>
<br> 
<h4 id="first">I am very glad to have been your student, as you are such an amazing teacher. You make the most complex of topics the easiest, and explain them to me over and over again, if I am not able to understand. Your feedback has never failed to make my work and projects better in many ways. You have helped and taught me so much, that I cannot imagine coding classes without your supervision and guidance.</h4>
<h4 id="second">To express my gratitude, I thought of writing you this letter, as a small token of thanks. I really hope I will meet you again ma'am, and that you will be my teacher once more. Once again, thank you very very much! </h4>
<br>
<h4 id="end">Best Wishes,<br> Madhuvanthi :)</h4>
